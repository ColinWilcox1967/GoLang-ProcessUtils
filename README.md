# GoLang-ProcessUtils
A simple Go package to provide support for process related functionalities

Supports three basic functions
(1) To Start and stop a running process by name.
(2) To return details of all processes currently running on target machine.
(3) To checked whether a named process is running on a machine.

Could have added more but that was all I needed at the time. Feel free to extend!
